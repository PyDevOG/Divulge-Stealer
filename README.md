# Divulge-Stealer
Divulge Stealer a highly advanced info-stealer that outperforms its predecessor, Umbral-Stealer by Blank-c. This new iteration is a complete overhaul with enhanced capabilities, targeting 25 major cryptocurrency wallets with precision.

Whatâ€™s New in Divulge Stealer:
1. Comprehensive Redesign: Divulge Stealer has been meticulously reworked from the ground up. Building on the foundation of Umbral-Stealer, it introduces advanced capabilities for targeting cryptocurrency wallets with unprecedented accuracy.

3. Recursive Data Extraction: Utilizing a sophisticated recursive technique, Divulge Stealer ensures thorough scanning and retrieval of wallet files, leaving no trace behind.

4. Signature Appending Feature: In a notable upgrade, the new build includes a feature allowing you to append another .exe digital signature upon compilation. This adds a layer of customization and stealth, making detection even more challenging.

5. Optimized: Removed useless features to make the overall output file much smaller.
